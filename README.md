"A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project predicting heart disease using clinical data. Includes EDA, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation."
Heart Disease Classification Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease presence using clinical data. The project showcases a complete data science workflow, including data exploration, model training, and performance evaluation.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify patients based on the likelihood of heart disease using various clinical features. The dataset used comes from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps Covered

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Data Preparation:

Splitting data into features and target labels.

Train-test split for model evaluation.

Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

Hyperparameter Tuning:

RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV applied for optimization.

Model Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

ROC Curves, Confusion Matrices, Feature Importance Plots.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Code

Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-link>

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided.

ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland Heart Disease dataset).

ðŸ“š Key Insights

Random Forest achieved the highest performance among the models tested.

Exploratory analysis revealed key influential features such as cholesterol levels and chest pain type.
